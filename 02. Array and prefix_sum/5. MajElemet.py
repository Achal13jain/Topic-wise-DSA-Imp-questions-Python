Problem: Majority Element
LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Why optimal: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm finds the majority element in linear time with constant space.
"""

# Find the element appearing more than n/2 times.

# 🔹 Idea (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
# Cancel out different elements
# Majority always survives
