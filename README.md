## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Achal13jain/Topic-wise-DSA-Imp-questions-Python.git
cd Topic-wise-DSA-Imp-questions-Python
```
2. **Navigate to a topic folder** based on what you want to practice
3. **Read the solution** to understand the approach and algorithm
4. **Note the time & space complexity** (usually in function docstring or comments)
5. **Try implementing** yourself before reading the solution
6. **Focus on _IMP problems** for quick interview prep

## 💡 Problem Markers

- **`_IMP`** suffix: Important interview questions - **prioritize these for interview prep**
- **Regular files**: Good for learning and building solid fundamentals

## 🔍 Complexity Notation

In this repository:
- **Time Complexity**: How fast the algorithm runs (e.g., O(n), O(n log n), O(n²))
- **Space Complexity**: Extra memory used (e.g., O(1), O(n))
- **Look for comments** in solutions mentioning these complexities

## 🚀 Best Practices & Tips

1. **Understand before coding** - Read the problem and understand what's needed
2. **Know your complexity** - Always be aware of time/space trade-offs
3. **Practice multiple approaches** - One problem can be solved many ways
4. **Review _IMP problems** - These appear frequently in interviews
5. **Write test cases** - Verify edge cases (empty inputs, single elements, etc.)
6. **Learn the pattern** - Each problem teaches a technique applicable elsewhere
